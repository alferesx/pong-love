--[[

When you use both conditions together:

Colliding Side (>): Confirms that the ball is moving towards the paddle.
Receiving Side (<): Ensures that the ball hasnâ€™t completely moved past the paddle yet.
The colliding side will cause the impact.
The receiving side will receive the impact.
3. Collision Detection Logic
Using both > and < effectively creates a comprehensive check for overlap:

If both conditions are true, it confirms a collision has occurred, indicating that the ball is interacting with the paddle.
Summary
So yes, you can think of the > side as representing the edge that will collide (the part that is moving toward the other object), 
and the < side as the edge that will receive the detection (the part that defines the boundary of the object being collided with). 
This duality is essential for accurate collision detection!]]--
